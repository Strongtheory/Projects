Running README:

* Solar Flare Dataset

* The dataset files are already included in the ABAGAIL directory under the opt.test package.

Part One:
* For part one, I used AbaloneTest.java in the ABAGAIL library and simply added a function
  to read in my solar flare testing and training .arff files. It is aleady included as a private
  method and you simply have to change the file name to alternate between them as well the iteration
  count to produce different results. To run backpropagation, I simply commented out all the randomized
  optimization algorithm calls and added backpropagation.

Part Two:
* For part two I simply ran the ContinuousPeaksTest, TravelingSalesmanTest, and KanpsackTest in the opt directory.
  I made no changes too the code aside the iteration count.

* I added the results for the first part in two text files and the average results for the second part
  in the analysis as a table.

* I also have included the results for the second part in graph form in the results excel file.
