* For this analysis I used RL_Sim made bu CMU from which the images also came from.
* To use RL_Sim, cd into the directory and execute the command 'java -jar rl_sim.jar'
* I used the policy iteration, value iteration, and p sweeping options for testing.
* For both policy iteration and value iteration I simply changed the PJOG value from 0.1-1.0
* For p sweeping I only changed the epsilon value.
* The mazes I used were included in the package.
  * The first maze I used is called medium_simple.maze -> (This is the simpler maze)
  * The second maze I used is cllaed big.maze -> (This is the more advanced maze)
* The RL_Sim package and files are included in the submission.
