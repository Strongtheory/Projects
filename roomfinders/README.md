## Pathfinders Backend

The backend for the Pathfinders/RoomFinders/Pathroomfinder app.

## Run Locally

To run the server locally, you will first need to set up the app's dependencies:
`virtualenv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, execute `foreman start` to run the server, which should be available at http://localhost:5000. Note, you will need to run `source venv/bin/activate` again if you close your Terminal window before foreman start will works.
