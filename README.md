          different types of technology such as JDB, JavaFX, Java server socket programming, and writing
          proper technical documentation. The project followed a Scrum process and is technically documented
          in the project itself.</td>

      <td align="center"> Yes (5) </td>
      <td>This is a capstone research project done in partnership with a researcher for disability at Georgia Tech.
          Our client requested a custom keyboard which has 10 keys, in which kids will be able to quickly learn to type
          and avoid having to memorize the QWERTY keyboard layout. In addition, this experiment is to help these kids to
          learn to type fast and improve spelling. This is done in a 5 man team with proper detailed design documentation.</td>
