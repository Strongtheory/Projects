Jumper: This is a 2-Dimensional android game using OpenGL.

Droid: This is a 3-Dimensional android game using OpenGL.

VRDart: This is a augmented reality game using computer vision techniques. Specifically the library
        OpenCV in c++. You need a projector, unix machine, and at 2 computers with a web camera to run the code.
        One computer is used for recording the dots thrown at the darts and the other computer is responsible for
        running the user interface which is then displayed through the projector. The darts must be dark as the
        code is set sense dark objects.
        Note: Darts don't necessarily need to be used for this game. You can also use black socks
        or balls of some sort.
