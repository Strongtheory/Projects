* All of the algorithms were run using weka with the exception of the Neural Network Portion.
* Note: RS is Random Subset
* For ISA I imported through the weka package manager the Student.Isa package which was created for this class
  by another student. Included below is the link to the repository:
* https://github.com/cgearhart/students-filters/
* For the Neural Networks, I used the abalone test but modified it to take in my own data. I will add this modified file of the abalone test
  to run the datasets. (This was the same appraoch I used for assignment 2)
