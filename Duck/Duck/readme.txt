Duck Hunt Game

Instructions:
Simply press A (shoot) when your scope or crosshair image that 
you control with arrow keys is over the moving birds.
This shoots them and the fall down and die as an explosion.
You have a total of 30 bullets for 15 ducks to shoot.
The difficult part is that you have to align the center of the crosshair
with the duck to count as a kill. You can't just hover over them.

Good Luck!
